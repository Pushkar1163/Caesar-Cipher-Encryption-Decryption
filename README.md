# Caesar-Cipher-Encryption-Decryption
Caesar Cipher Encryption/Decryption This project is a simple implementation of the Caesar cipher encryption and decryption algorithm using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The Caesar cipher is a substitution cipher that replaces each letter in the plaintext with a letter a certain number of positions down the alphabet.
Examples
Encryption If you want to encrypt the message "HELLO" with a shift of 3, the resulting ciphertext will be "KHOOR".

Decryption
To decrypt the ciphertext "KHOOR" with a shift of 3, the original plaintext "HELLO" will be recovered.

Files
The project consists of the following files:

index.html: The HTML file containing the user interface and JavaScript code.
style.css: The CSS file for styling the user interface.
script.js: The JavaScript file containing the implementation of the Caesar cipher algorithm.

Compatibility
This Caesar cipher encryption/decryption tool should work on most modern web browsers that support JavaScript. No additional libraries or frameworks are required.
